# Bank Project

## BankBros

Otzar Jaffe, Christopher Louie
       
## Project Description:

We are building a bank application that demonstrates the functionality and concepts of the banking system. Our bank project will simulate transactions between users.
  
## Instructions:
### How does the user install/compile/run the program?
The user installs this bank program via cloning this repo.
The user compiles via make compile. The user will then receive instructions on how to make a bank with make run, and user actions such as creating an account using ./user Create.

### How does the user interact with this program?
First, in another terminal, run ./bank to make a bank.
Then, users can enter ./user ''
1.   'Create' makes a user.
2.   'Transaction' lets you give money to another user.
3.   'Deposit' lets you deposit money.
4.   'Withdraw' lets you withdraw money.
5.   'Info' gives you the information for one user.
While not listed in the user instructions, the operator can also enter cat log.txt to see a history of bank processes.
